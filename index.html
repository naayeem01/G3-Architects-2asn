            <p>Architecture, the art and technique of designing and building, as distinguished from the skills
                associated with construction. <br> The practice of architecture is employed to fulfill both practical
                and
                expressive requirements, and thus it serves both utilitarian and aesthetic ends.

                    <div class="section-description">The characteristics that distinguish a work of architecture from
                        other built structures are (1) the suitability of the work to use by human beings in general and
                        the adaptability of it to particular human activities, (2) the stability and permanence of the
                        workâ€™s construction, and (3) the communication of experience and ideas through its form. All
                        these conditions must be met in architecture. The second is a constant, while the first and
                        third vary in relative importance according to the social function of buildings. If the function
                        is chiefly utilitarian, as in a factory, communication is of less importance. If the function is
                        chiefly expressive, as in a monumental tomb, utility is a minor concern. In some buildings, such
                        as churches and city halls, utility and communication may be of equal importance.</div>
